The `dipr` package is an R package that loads and provides means of caching of `.dat.gz` files. Functions are also provided to convert from `.dat.gz` files to Apache Arrow formats.

## Installation
While this package is intended for us within the SRE you can install the package from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/dipr")
```



## Installation inside the SRE
Installation of `dipr` is slightly different than typical R package installation. To begin with you will need to clone the dipr repo. To do this you need access to the SRE instance of GitLab. 

Go to this website: https://projectsc.popdata.bc.ca/

Scroll down and click on "Sign in with Pop Data Sso"

You will need to do this step everytime you log into the SRE.

Next go to this site: https://projectsc.popdata.bc.ca/profile/personal_access_tokens

Create a new Personal Access Token enabling each scope and typing in your username. This should create a new personal access token. Those are your "git credentials". Save those on your "U" drive along with your user name. 

### Install from R

```{r eval=FALSE}
## First you need to store your credentials created in the step above. This is a one time only thing
token <- credentials::git_credential_ask("https://projectsc.popdata.bc.ca")$password

## These next two lines download the package to a temporary folder and install it. 
resp <- httr::GET("https://projectsc.popdata.bc.ca/api/v4/projects/90/repository/archive.tar.gz",
                  query = list(sha = "v1.2.1"),
                  httr::write_disk(tempfile(fileext = ".tar.gz")),
                  config = httr::add_headers(`Private-token` = token))
remotes::install_local(resp[["content"]])
```




## Usage
The `dipr` package comes with some sample _fake_ data to illustrate the usage of the package and facilitate unit tests. Specifically, the package provides a fake data dictionary and a compressed data file. Example fake data can be seen like this:
```{r}
library(dipr)
dipr_examples()
```

Individual paths can be extracted like this:
```{r}
data_dict_path <- dipr_example("starwars-dict.txt")
dict <- read.table(data_dict_path)
dict
dat_path <- dipr_example("starwars-fwf.dat.gz")
```

The main function in the package is `read_dat()` which allows you to directly read `.dat.gz files:
```{r}
raw <- read_dat(data_path = dat_path,
                data_dict = dict)
head(raw)
```

If two files share a common data dictionary you can supply a vector of filenames to the `data_path` argument and `read_dat` will combine them for you into one dataframe:

```{r}
dat_path2 <- dipr_example("starwars-fwf2.dat.gz")
raw_two_files <- read_dat(
    data_path = c(dat_path, dat_path2),
    data_dict = dict,
    id = "file"
  )
```

Working with the data.table package for data manipulation is also possible in dipr using the `read_dat_dt` function:
```{r}
raw_dt <- read_dat_dt(
    data_path = dat_path,
    data_dict = dict
  )
```


### Data Dictionary
Data Dictionaries need to be in a data frame format that includes 'name`, 'start', 'stop', and 'length' columns (in any order):

```r
> dict
# A tibble: 64 x 4
   start  stop length name                      
   <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>   
```
